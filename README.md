# 🚀 RAG Mastery — Interactive Learning Platform
### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Basic → Advanced)

> An animated, interactive platform designed to teach Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) from fundamentals to production-grade architecture.

## 🔥 Overview

**RAG Mastery** is a visually immersive and interactive web-based learning system that explains:

- What is RAG?
- Why LLMs hallucinate
- How retrieval fixes hallucination
- The complete 7-step RAG pipeline
- Chunking strategies (with interactive lab)
- Embeddings visualization
- Vector database intuition
- Retrieval & ranking logic
- Grounded generation
- Production-level best practices

Unlike traditional tutorials, this project focuses on:

> **Concept → Code → Visualization → Interaction**

Users don’t just read about RAG — they experiment with it.

## 🧠 Why RAG?

Large Language Models:

- ❌ Do not know your private data
- ❌ Hallucinate confidently
- ❌ Cannot access fresh documents

RAG solves this:
