# 🚀 Interactive Live RAG — Visual Learning Platform
### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Basic → Advanced)

> A fully interactive and dynamic platform designed to teach Retrieval-Augmented Generation in the simplest, most visual, and most intuitive way possible.

---

## 🔥 Overview

**Interactive RAG** is not a traditional tutorial.

It is a dynamic, experiment-driven learning experience where complex RAG architecture becomes simple through:

- Live visualization
- Real-time simulation
- Interactive controls
- Production-grade code examples

Unlike static blogs or notebooks, this platform follows:

> **Concept → Code → Visualization → Interaction**

Users don’t just read about RAG — they experiment with it.

## 🧠 Why RAG?

Large Language Models:

- ❌ Do not know your private data  
- ❌ Hallucinate confidently  
- ❌ Cannot access fresh documents  

RAG solves this by:

```
Retrieve relevant chunks → Inject into prompt → Generate grounded answer
```

This platform explains that complete workflow step-by-step with interactive demonstrations.
